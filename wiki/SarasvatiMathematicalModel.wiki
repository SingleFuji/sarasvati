#summary A concise mathematical description of the Sarasvati model

== The Model ==
A Sarasvati executable graph is defined as directed graph, with a token mapping of node and arc tokens over that graph.

Formally, a Sarasvati graph execution *S* is defined as

*S* = {*N*, *A*, *T,,N,,*, *T,,A,,*}.

where 

  * *N* is the set of nodes in the graph
    * Every node *n* in *N* may be either a join node, or a non-join node.
    * The function _isjoin_ maps *N* to the set of boolean values, indicating whether or not the node is a join or not.
  * *A* is the set of arcs in the graph
  * *T,,N,,* is the set of active node tokens
  * *T,,A,,* is the set of active arc tokens

in addition

  * Every arc *a* in *A* is defined as the tuple ( *n,,start,,*, *n,,end,,*, *name* ) where *n,,start,,*, *n,,end,,* are elements of *N* and the arc goes from *n,,start,,* to *n,,end,,*. *name* is a non-unique identifier, used to group arcs into sets. 
  * For a given node *n* belonging to *N* and arc identifier *ident*, every arc *a* with *a,,start,,* = *n* and *name* = *ident* belongs to *n,,out(ident),,*. 
    * This corresponds to the set of outgoing arcs from *n* with identifier *ident*.
  * For a given node *n* belonging to *N* and arc identifier *ident*, every arc *a* with *a,,end,,* = *n* and *name* = *ident* belongs to *n,,in(ident),,*. 
    * This corresponds to the set of incoming arcs to *n* with identifier *ident*.
  * A node token *t,,n,,* belonging to *T,,N,,* is defined as {*n*}, where *n* is a member of *N*.
  * An arc token *t,,a,,* belonging to *T,,A,,* is defined as {*a*} where *a* is a member of *A*.

== Changing State ==

An execution proceeds from state *S,,i,,* to state *S,,i+1,,* when a node token (element of *T,,N,,*) is completed.

*S,,i,,* = (*N*, *A*, *T,,N,,(i)*, *T,,A,,(i))

Node token completion also depends on arc token completion. 

_*completeArc*_( *S,,i,,*, *t,,a,,* ) = 

  if _isjoin_( *a,,start,,* ) then
    

Node token completion is a function, _*completeNode*_( *S,,i,,*, *t,,n,,*, *ident* ) = *S,,i+1,,*

*S,,i+1,,* = (*N*, *A*, *T,,N,,(i)* - *t,,n,,*, *T,,A,,(i)* + *n,,out(ident),,*)
