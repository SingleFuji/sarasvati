The process definition file format is defined by an XSD, which can [http://code.google.com/p/sarasvati/source/browse/common/workflow.xsd available to view in the project SVN].

The simplest possible process definition look like:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<workflow name="simplest"
          xmlns="http://sarasvati.googlecode.com/workflow/"
          schemaLocation="../workflow.xsd">

  <node name="start" isStart="true">
  </node>

</workflow>
}}}
