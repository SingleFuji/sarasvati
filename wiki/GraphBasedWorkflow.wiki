#summary Why graphs are good for describing workflow

[Workflow <-- What is Workflow]

= Introduction =

There are different ways of representing workflows. For example, one could just list out the actions along with their dependencies. The engine could then properly sequence the actions, 

For example, the simple Order Fulfillment example could be defined as

|| *#* || *Task*             || *Resource* || *Depends on* ||
|| 1   || Enter Order        || Sales      ||  -           ||
|| 2   || Bill Customer      || Billing    || 1            ||
|| 3   || Ship Product       || Warehouse  || 1            ||
|| 4   || Market to Customer || Marketing  || 2,3          ||

While this would work fine for simple workflows, it doesn't offer a way to define cycles. If for example, the warehouse people determine that they are out of stock, they may need to send the workflow back to the sales department so they can interact with the customer. This mechanism also lacks a clear means of flow control. For example, a single workflow may cover the order fulfillment process for many different product types. It is likely that some sections of the workflow would only apply to specific products.
