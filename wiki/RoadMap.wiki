===Documentation: Not yet started===
 # Documentation needs to be updated for changes. 
 # It also need to be shipped with the release, rather than just available on the project WIKI. 
   * Need to find a WIKI -> HTML compiler. 
   * Or alternately, need to write documentation in alternate form and repoint the website documentation to generate HTML.

=== Performance Tuning: Not yet started ===

Need to load 1k, 10k, 100k and maybe 1M process definitions, and make sure the hibernate backend still performs well. Will probably need to add indexes in some places.

Will need to run 1k, 10k, 100k and maybe 1M processes through and check performance.

=== Broader Database support: In progress ===

  * Investigate if schema can be generate from Hibernate mappings
    * Issue with generating FKs to enum tables
    * Issue text columns on postgesql vs varchars in other dbs
  * Investigate table name mappings, so users can pick their own table names
    * Use hibernate NamingStrategy
    * Make sure we don't hardcode tables/column name, if possible.
  * Need test suite for DB
    * Test against following databases
      * Postgresql
      * Sybase
      * MySQL
      * Oracle
      * DB2
      * Some simple file based engine? BerkleyDB?

=== JDBC Backend: In progress ===

May not get to this pre-1.0 release. However, this would be good as a fall back for users who don't use hibernate. Also, it would make sure that the interfaces are sufficiently flexible.

Implementation started in trunk.

==Post 1.0 Release==

Possibilities:

  * Improve Editor (expression editor?)
  * Improve visualizations
  * Additional backends?
  * Porting to .NET/Python/Ruby?
    * Porting to C# is a priority, based on request.
