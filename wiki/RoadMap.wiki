= Roadmap =

Sarasvati is fairly stable at this point, and we are workings towards a 1.0 release. 

== 1.0 TODO ==

=== Editor ===

A graphical editor for process definitions is in progress. 

 * Load: Done
 * Save: 50% done
 * Add nodes: Done with undo/redo support.
 * Delete nodes: TBD
 * Add external: TBD
 * Delete external: TBD
 * Move nodes: Done with undo/redo support.
 * Connect nodes: Done. TODO: undo/redo support.
 * Change connections: Done. TODO: undo/redo support.
 * Remove connections: Done. TODO: undo/redo support.
 * Undo/Redo Framework: Implemented
 * Edit node properties: Started
 * Edit arc properties: TBD
 * Cleanup undo/redo MDI interactions: Done

=== Template Node ===

Design work for templates has started. Will probably included the notion of token sets, which may be useful in other contexts.

Implementation started in a feature branch.

=== Performance Tuning ===

Need to load 1k, 10k, 100k and maybe 1M process definitions, and make sure the hibernate backend still performs well. Will probably need to add indexes in some places.

Will need to run 1k, 10k, 100k and maybe 1M processes through and check performance.

=== JDBC Backend ===

May not get to this pre-1.0 release. However, this would be good as a fall back for users who don't use hibernate. Also, it would make sure that the interfaces are sufficiently flexible.

Implementation started in trunk.

==Post 1.0 Release==

Possibilities:

  * Improve Editor (expression editor?)
  * Improve visualizations
  * Additional backends?
  * Porting to .NET/Python/Ruby?
    * Porting to C# is a priority, based on request.
