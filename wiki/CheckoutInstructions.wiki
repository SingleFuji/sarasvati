#summary SVN checkout instructions

= NOTE: Non-Standard SVN Layout =

Because Sarasvati has multiple implementations in different languages, the source control is organized somewhat differently from the default layout.

Each langauge has it's own top level folder, under which is the usual branches/ tags/ trunk/ layout. There is also a common/ folder for shared files, such as licenses, database schema and some global documenation. 

You can also [http://code.google.com/p/sarasvati/source/browse browse the SVN repository] as well see a [http://code.google.com/p/sarasvati/source/list list of commits].
